Explanation:

You must use port name for testing project. You must create ".env" file for this, I put port name in ".env.example" file for easily checking. 

After starting project, you write "/swagger" endpoint next to port. So, in here you can see and test all endpoints in backend side. 

As database, i use SQLite.

And most importantly, I want to point out that I only worked on the backend part. Although I have some experience with the frontend, these were very small things. In my experiences working as a full stack, I also worked as a full stack with a heavy backend. That's why I wanted to be honest with you that I didn't work on the frontend part of this project. I thought I should tell you this because I have little experience, and I also wanted to let you know in advance because I wouldn't be enthusiastic about frontend tasks if I were hired. I could do the frontend of this task through AI or with someone, but as I said, I wanted to be honest.

As for the backend part, I think I'm both very good (you can analyze the code - I think I took every detail into account), and I'm very enthusiastic. I also have a lot of experience with Python / Django, so I can help you in this way if we work together.

Thanks!
